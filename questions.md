# Refactoring

- do I need the whole alternate jsx combo in LED.js? feels like I should be able to do better with props
- ...like, a theme handed in from the container? I want to give each LED: color r/g/b, initStatus on/off
- should the on/off state logic live above?
- how to generate the LEDs programatically so they fill the screen?
